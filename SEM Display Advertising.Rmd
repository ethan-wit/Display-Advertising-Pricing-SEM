Display advertisement is bought and sold in online marketplaces --  firms purchase space on publishers' webpages to display their advertisements. For budgeting purposes, it is in a firm's interest to understand the determinants of advertisement price. This analysis applies a Two-Stage Least Squares Regression to a system of equations to estimate advertisement eqilibrium price. Price may be placed in a budgeting model (Expected Quantity of Advertisements $\times$ Equilibrium price) to predict the firm's advertising spend.

#### Simultaneous Equations Model

<br>
\medskip

##### Structural Equations

<br>
\medskip

$P_{Dt} = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1} Q_{t} + \beta_{2} Cash_{t}  + \beta_{3} Print_{t} + u_{Dt}$

<br>
\medskip

$P_{St} = \alpha _{0} + \alpha _{1} Q_{t} + \alpha_{2} Serve_{t} + u_{St}$

<br>
\bigskip


|       $P_{Dt}$ = Inverse Demand - Price bid

|       $P_{St}$ = Inverse Supply - Price ask

|       $Q_{t}$ = Exchange Quantity of Display Advertisements

|       $Cash_{t}$ = Index of Net Cash Flow for Buyers

|       $Print_{t}$ = Price of Print (Offline) Advertisement

|       $Serve_{t}$ = Cost to Serve Advertisement

|       $u_{Dt}$ = Error term Demand

|       $u_{St}$ = Error term Supply

#### Reduced-Form Equation

<br>
\medskip

Through algebraic manipulation, the reduced-form equation for Quantity is determined. It becomes apparent that $Q_{t}$ is correlated with the error terms in both structural equations:

<br>
\medskip

$\textbf{Q}_{t} = \cfrac{\alpha_{0} + \alpha_{2} Serve_{t} + \textbf{u}_{St} - \beta_{0} - \beta_{2} Cash_{t} - \beta_{3} Print_{t} - \textbf{u}_{Dt}}{\beta_{1} - \alpha_{1}}$

<br>
\medskip

This defines $Q_{t}$ as an endogenous variable, meaning it is determined within the system of equations. This introduces an endogeneity bias into the simultaneous equations model, which occurs when an independent variable, such as $Q_{t}$, is endogenous. A different method is necessary to produce unbiased parameters -- this analysis uses Two-Stage Least Squares. 

<br>
\medskip

#### Two-Stage Least Squares

<br>
\medskip

In this instance, the Two-Stage Least Squares method is used to absolve the simultaneous equations model of endogeneity bias. It does this by estimating a fitted value for the endogenous independent variable through the use of Instrumental Variables. $Print_{t}$ and $Cash_{t}$ are instruments for Quantity in the supply equation, and $Serve_{t}$ is an instrument for Quantity in the demand equation.

<br>
\medskip

Three criteria must be met for a variable to be use as an instrument -- they are as follows:

<br>
\medskip

1. Correlated with the endogenous independent variable


2. Uncorrelated with the error term


3. Not already included in the structural equation

<br>
\medskip

Statisical tests such as the Durbin-Wu-Hausman and Stock-Yogo can test for endogeneity and the strength of instruments, respectively. 

<br>
\medskip

##### Fitted Quantity

<br>
\medskip

$\hat{Q}_{t} = \gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1} Print_{t} + \gamma_{2} Serve_{t} + \gamma_{3} Cash_{t} + u_{t}$

<br>
\medskip


#### Identified Structural Equations

<br>
\medskip

$P_{Dt} = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1} \hat{Q}_{t} + \beta_{2} Cash_{t} + \beta_{3} Print_{t} + u_{Dt}$

<br>
\medskip

$P_{St} = \alpha _{0} + \alpha _{1} \hat{Q}_{t} + \alpha_{2} Serve_{t} + u_{St}$

<br>
\medskip

Barring serial correlation, the identified structural equations are rid of endogeneity and are able to produce unbiased parameters to predict equilibrium price.
